### Motivations

#### Why this particular application?

Disaster strikes. Often with no warning. But what if there is warning? Do you know where to go?
Do you know when to go there? Can you get there even if you had no warning? Ideally, you seek
refuge even before disaster strikes. But can you believe the warnings?

All of these questions are much more life-and-death in the developing world. Even if you are
lucky enough to survive uninjured, the economic aftereffects can ripple for years, dimming
your life prospects and the lives your loved ones, and much more so if you were forced to
escape with no preparation.

LESAT is a proposed mobile app that can help people cope better with disasters, through increased awareness
of disaster risks and through training in what to do when disaster strikes, BEFORE disaster strikes.

#### Why the Philippines, to start?

LESAT is initially targeted for the Philippines, a nation with frequent disasters of
great variety: typhoons, mudslides, flooding, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes and
tsunamis. An advanced industrial democracy like Japan, with its high GDP per capita,
and high political cohesiveness, copes with a similar range of threats to its population,
and manages to do so very well. The Philippines is poor, its government agencies
aren't as well-funded or as well-regulated, and its political cohesiveness is not
as strong, with some regions even pursuing autonomy arrangements. (We might even
add "urban warfare" to the threat categories.) In this, it matches
the description of much of the developing world. But other nations suffer from
a similar range of disasters. Why the Philippines especially?

For an app to be developed in Japan, the Philippines is in fact a very good
first choice among the plethora of nations that match the same criteria. It is roughly
time-zone-aligned with Japan, which makes communications and coordination easier
over the phone and by internet. The Philippines is not far from Japan, which reduces the cost
of of the app's requirements. Japan hosts a large population of Filipinos (relative to other
nationalities represented in Japan), and the relations between the two nations
(despite past troubles) seem to be strengthening. In recent years, this strengthening
can fairly be described as dramatic in the area of capacity development for the Philippines'
space program. Perhaps the best evidence for this is in the fruits of the cooperation between that
program and several Japanese universities with excellent reputations in engineering:
the Philippines has put up several small satellites with Japanese help.

#### DRM App as local-to-international people-connector

In some longer run, the Philippines may even be able to serve its own satellite remote sensing needs
with its own engineers. In the meantime, however, Japan-Philippines cooperation helps cement the relations
between governments. The problem is how to cement the relationship between these intergovernmental
efforts and any true benefits for a disaster-beleagured population: how make a concrete connection between
space-based disaster-related management information and the deployment of local resources
for coordination and relief. This is where LESAT comes in.
